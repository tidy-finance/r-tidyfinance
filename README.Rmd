This repository contains an R package that collects helper functions for developers and researchers familiar with [Tidy Finance with R](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/index.html). The functions provide shortcuts to selected issues that the book discusses in detail.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `tidyfinance` from CRAN via:

``` r
install.packages("tidyfinance")
```

You can install the development version of `tidyfinance` from [GitHub](https://github.com/tidy-finance/r-tidyfinance) via:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidy-finance/r-tidyfinance")
```

## Usage

### Download Data

The main functionality of the `tidyfinance` package centers around data download. You can download most of the data that we used in [Tidy Finance with R](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/index.html) using the `download_data()` function or its children. For instance, both functions give the same result:

``` r
download_data(
  type = "factors_ff_3_monthly", 
  start_date = "2000-01-01", 
  end_date = "2020-12-31"
)

download_data_factors_ff(
  type = "factors_ff_3_monthly", 
  start_date = "2000-01-01", 
  end_date = "2020-12-31"
)
```

You can also download data directly from [WRDS](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/wrds-crsp-and-compustat.html) (if you have set your credentials via `Sys.setenv(WRDS_USER = "your_username", WRDS_PASSWORD = "your_password")`), e.g.,

```r
download_data(
  type = "wrds_compustat_annual", 
  start_date = "2000-01-01", 
  end_date = "2020-12-31"
)
```

If you want to fetch additional columns that are not included in our default selection, then pass them as additional arguments in the corresponding child function:

```r
download_data_wrds_compustat(
  type = "wrds_compustat_annual",  
  start_date = "2000-01-01", 
  end_date = "2020-12-31",
  acoxar, amc, aldo
)
```

You can get a list of all currently supported types via `list_supported_types()`. Please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tidy-finance/r-tidyfinance/issues) to request additional supported types. 

### Other Helpers

We include functions to check out content from [tidy-finance.org](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/index.html):

```r
list_tidy_finance_chapters()
open_tidy_finance_website()
```

There are also some simple helpers for regression analyses:

```r
winsorize()
trim()
create_summary_statistics()
```

We also include (experimental) functions that can be used for different applications, but note that they might heavily change in future package versions as we try to make them more general:

```r
# For portfolio sorts
assign_portfolio()

# For beta estimation
estimate_model()
```
