\title{Adjust NASDAQ Trading Volume (Gao & Ritter 2010)}
\usage{
volume_adjustment_gao_ritter(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing CRSP stock data with the following
columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{vol}}{Trading volume (shares traded)}
\item{\code{prc}}{Closing price}
\item{\code{cfacpr}}{Cumulative adjustment factor for prices}
\item{\code{exchcd}}{Exchange code (3 = NASDAQ)}
\item{\code{date}}{Trading date}
}}
}
\value{
The input data frame with the following modifications and additions:
\describe{
\item{\code{vol}}{Volume with -99 values converted to \code{NA}}
\item{\code{prc}}{Price with 0 values converted to \code{NA}}
\item{\code{prc_adj}}{Adjusted price, calculated as |prc| / cfacpr}
\item{\code{vol_adj}}{Adjusted volume based on exchange and time period}
}
}
\description{
Applies the Gao and Ritter (2010) adjustment to NASDAQ trading volume data
to correct for double-counting of trades. NASDAQ historically reported
trading volume differently than other exchanges, requiring adjustment for
accurate cross-sectional comparisons. This function also calculates adjusted
prices.
}
\details{
The adjustment divides NASDAQ trading volume (\code{exchcd == 3}) by different
factors depending on the time period:
\itemize{
\item Before 2001-02-01: divide by 2.0
\item 2001-02-01 to 2001-12-31: divide by 1.8
\item 2002-01-01 to 2003-12-31: divide by 1.6
\item 2004-01-01 onwards: divide by 1.0 (no adjustment)
}
Non-NASDAQ stocks retain their original volume.
